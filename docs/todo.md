# Orca - TODO

## Upstream Bugs

- [ ] **agent-deck `remove` silently fails when worktree is already gone** — `agent-deck remove <id>` reports "Removed session" (exit code 0) but does NOT actually delete the session from the DB when the session's worktree path no longer exists as a git worktree. Reproduction: (1) create a session with a worktree via `agent-deck add -w branch`, (2) manually remove the worktree outside of agent-deck (e.g. `git worktree remove`), (3) run `agent-deck remove <id>` — it prints "Removed session" but `agent-deck list` still shows it and the `instances` table still has the row. The worktree removal failure (`fatal: '/path' is not a working tree`) is printed as a "Warning" but causes the DB deletion to be silently skipped. Fix should be in agent-deck's remove logic: worktree cleanup failure should not prevent session DB deletion. Orca works around this by falling back to direct DB deletion. File a PR at the agent-deck repo.

- [ ] **agent-deck doesn't support passing arguments to tools** — The `-c` flag only accepts a tool name (e.g., `claude`), not arguments to pass to the tool. This means you can't use Claude Code's built-in support for initial prompts (`claude "prompt here"`). Instead, Orca must use `tmux send-keys` to send the prompt after the session starts (see `agentdeck.rs:659-733`). While the current implementation works reliably and handles async startup timing, it would be cleaner if agent-deck supported tool arguments (e.g., `-c 'claude "initial prompt"'` or a separate `--tool-args` flag). This would allow using Claude's native prompt argument instead of tmux keystroke injection. File a feature request at the agent-deck repo.
